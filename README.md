# escape
## _Event Synchronous Categorisation And Processing Environment_

A high level, object oriented framework which abstracs event processing to high level objects. This is the successor project of ixppy, which used lazy evaluation steps for large data volumes. Here dask ist used for such evaluation allowing to scale evaluation on clusters or multi-processor machines.

## Usage
```python
import escape as esc

esc.data

```
